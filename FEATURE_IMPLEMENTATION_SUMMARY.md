# Kurobara Feature Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the three requested features for Kurobara:

1. **User Profile Customization** - Allow users to change their avatar and link external accounts
2. **Logout Feature** - Proper logout with backend token invalidation
3. **Session Management** - Automatic logout when browser window is closed

## üîß Backend Changes

### Database Schema Updates

**File: `backend/app/models/user.py`**
- Added `anilist_username` field (String, 100 chars, nullable)
- Added `myanimelist_username` field (String, 100 chars, nullable)

**File: `backend/app/schemas/user.py`**
- Updated `UserBase` schema to include new external account fields
- Updated `UserUpdate` schema to allow updating external account links

### Authentication & Security

**File: `backend/app/core/deps.py`**
- Added global Redis client management for token blacklisting
- Updated `get_current_user` to check for blacklisted tokens
- Added `set_redis_client` function for startup initialization

**File: `backend/app/core/events.py`**
- Modified startup handler to set global Redis client

**File: `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/auth.py`**
- Added `/logout` endpoint that blacklists the current token
- Token blacklist uses Redis with TTL matching token expiration
- Imports updated to include necessary dependencies

### Database Migration

**File: `backend/alembic/versions/001_add_external_account_links.py`**
- Created migration to add external account fields to users table
- Includes both upgrade and downgrade functions

## üé® Frontend Changes

### Enhanced Profile Management

**File: `frontend/app/src/views/auth/Profile.vue`**
- Added form fields for:
  - Full Name
  - Bio (textarea)
  - Avatar URL
  - AniList Username
  - MyAnimeList Username
- Updated read-only view to display new fields with proper formatting
- Added clickable links to external profiles with external link icons
- Avatar preview in profile display
- Updated form data structure and submission logic

### Session Management & Logout

**File: `frontend/app/src/stores/auth.js`**
- Enhanced `logout()` to call backend logout endpoint
- Updated token storage to support both localStorage and sessionStorage
- Modified `login()` to accept `rememberMe` parameter
- Token storage logic:
  - `rememberMe = true`: Uses localStorage (persists across browser sessions)
  - `rememberMe = false`: Uses sessionStorage (clears when browser closes)

**File: `frontend/app/src/views/auth/Login.vue`**
- Updated login handler to pass `rememberMe` value to auth store
- "Remember me" checkbox already existed and is now functional

### UI Improvements

**File: `frontend/app/src/layouts/DefaultLayout.vue`**
- Updated user avatar display in both desktop and mobile navigation
- Shows actual user avatar image if available, falls back to initials
- Consistent avatar display across all navigation areas

## üîÑ How the Features Work

### 1. User Profile Customization

Users can now:
- Upload/set an avatar URL that displays throughout the application
- Add a bio that appears on their profile
- Link their AniList account (with clickable link to their profile)
- Link their MyAnimeList account (with clickable link to their profile)
- Update their full name and other basic information

### 2. Proper Logout Feature

The logout process now:
1. Calls the backend `/v1/auth/logout` endpoint
2. Backend adds the current token to a Redis blacklist with TTL
3. All subsequent requests with that token are rejected
4. Frontend clears both localStorage and sessionStorage
5. User is redirected to login page

### 3. Session Management

Token storage behavior:
- **Remember Me Checked**: Token stored in localStorage (survives browser restart)
- **Remember Me Unchecked**: Token stored in sessionStorage (cleared when browser closes)
- On app initialization, checks both storage locations for existing tokens

## üöÄ Testing the Features

### Profile Customization
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to "Your Profile" from the user menu
3. Click "Edit" to modify profile information
4. Add avatar URL, bio, and external account usernames
5. Save changes and verify display in both profile and navigation

### Logout Feature
1. Log in to the application
2. Click "Sign out" from the user menu
3. Verify redirection to login page
4. Attempt to use the old token (should be rejected)

### Session Management
1. **Test Remember Me = False**:
   - Log in without checking "Remember me"
   - Close browser completely
   - Reopen browser and navigate to the app
   - Should be redirected to login page

2. **Test Remember Me = True**:
   - Log in with "Remember me" checked
   - Close browser completely
   - Reopen browser and navigate to the app
   - Should remain logged in

## üêõ Login Issue Fix

**Issue**: Login was not working - "nothing happens when trying to log in"
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues with login flow:
1. Backend login endpoint wasn't returning user data
2. Frontend token storage wasn't checking sessionStorage
3. User model serialization issue

**Solution**: Fixed login flow with:

- Updated backend login endpoint to return user data along with tokens
- Created `LoginResponse` schema to properly structure the response
- Fixed User model serialization using `UserSchema.model_validate()`
- Updated frontend token initialization to check both localStorage and sessionStorage
- Fixed API service interceptors to handle both storage types

**Files Updated for Login Fix**:
- `backend/app/schemas/auth.py` - Added LoginResponse schema
- `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/auth.py` - Updated login endpoint response
- `frontend/app/src/main.js` - Fixed token initialization
- `frontend/app/src/services/api.js` - Updated interceptors for dual storage
- `frontend/app/src/stores/auth.js` - Improved error handling

## üêõ Redis Connection Fix

**Issue**: Redis authentication error when no password is configured
**Solution**: Made Redis connection more robust with:

- Conditional password parameter (only added if configured)
- Connection testing with ping before use
- Graceful fallback when Redis is unavailable
- Error handling for Redis operations
- Token blacklisting works when Redis is available, gracefully degrades when not

**Files Updated for Redis Fix**:
- `backend/app/core/events.py` - Improved Redis connection setup
- `backend/app/core/deps.py` - Made Redis dependency optional
- `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/auth.py` - Added Redis error handling

## üìù Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- External account links open in new tabs
- Avatar images are displayed with proper fallbacks
- Token blacklisting prevents token reuse after logout (when Redis is available)
- Session management respects user preferences for persistence
- Application works with or without Redis (logout still works, just without token blacklisting)

## üîß Database Migration

To apply the database changes, run:
```bash
# In the backend directory
alembic upgrade head
```

The migration will add the new external account fields to the existing users table.

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

- Redis/Valkey is optional - the application will work without it
- When Redis is unavailable, logout still works but tokens won't be blacklisted
- Check Redis configuration if you want token blacklisting functionality
- No password should be set in Redis config if VALKEY_PASSWORD is not configured
